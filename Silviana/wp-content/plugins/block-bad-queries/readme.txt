The fastest firewall plugin for WordPress.



== Description ==

> Install, activate, and done!<br/>
> Powerful protection from WP's __fastest__ firewall plugin.

[Block Bad Queries](https://perishablepress.com/block-bad-queries/) (BBQ) is a simple, super-fast plugin that protects your site against malicious URL requests. BBQ checks all incoming traffic and quietly blocks bad requests containing nasty stuff like `eval(`, `base64_`, and excessively long request-strings. This is a simple yet solid solution for sites that are unable to use a [strong .htaccess firewall](https://perishablepress.com/6g/). 

> GDPR-compliant: does not collect any user data
> Gutenberg-compliant: works perfectly with or without Gutenberg

== Upgrade Notice ==

== Screenshots ==

Sorry, there are no screenshots for BBQ! Everything is done behind the scenes.

The free version of BBQ is strictly plug-n-play, set-it-and-forget-it, with no settings to configure whatsoever. Just install, activate, and enjoy better security and robust protection against malicious requests.

The Pro version of BBQ is just as fast and simple to use, but is much more powerful and includes settings to customize and fine-tune your firewall. [Check out screenshots of BBQ Pro](https://plugin-planet.com/bbq-pro/#screenshots) (click the three grey buttons near the top of the page).



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What other security plugins do you recommend?**

I recently recorded a video tutorial series for Lynda.com on [how to secure WordPress sites](https://m0n.co/securewp). That's a good place to learn more about the best techniques and WP plugins for protecting your site against threats.


**Do I need to do anything else for BBQ to work?**

Nope, just install and relax knowing that BBQ is protecting your site from bad URL requests.


**I don't see any Settings whatsoever? Where is the settings?**

No settings needed for BBQ! Everything is done automatically behind the scenes. Zero configuration required. The free version of BBQ is strictly plug-n-play, set-it-and-forget-it, with no settings to configure whatsoever. Just install, activate, and enjoy better security and robust protection against malicious requests. The Pro version of BBQ is just as fast and simple to use, but is much more powerful and includes robust settings to customize and fine-tune your firewall.


**Is BBQ free version compatible with Wordfence? Does it makes sense to use both?**

Yes BBQ free and BBQ Pro are both compatible with any plugin written according to the WP API. And yes, there is benefit to using BBQ with any other security plugin, including Wordfence. They protect against different threats, so using both means you are extra secure.


**Does BBQ make changes to my .htaccess file?**

Absolutely not. Unlike other security/firewall plugins, neither BBQ (free version) nor BBQ Pro make any changes to any .htaccess file.


**Does BBQ make any changes to my WP database?**

No, the free version of BBQ operates as each page is loaded; it does not make any changes whatsoever to the WP database.


**Does BBQ block malicious strings included in arrays?**

Yes, BBQ scans any arrays that are included in the URI request. If any matching patterns are found, the request is blocked.


**Do I need WordPress to run BBQ?**

Nope! BBQ is available in the following flavors:

* [BBQ Free - WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-bad-queries/)
* [BBQ Pro - WordPress Plugin](https://plugin-planet.com/bbq-pro/)
* [BBQ Standalone PHP Script](https://perishablepress.com/block-bad-queries/#bbq-php-script)

So you can check out the Standalone PHP Script for sites that are not running WordPress.


**Do you offer any other security plugins?**

Yes, check out [Blackhole for Bad Bots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blackhole-bad-bots/) to protect your site against bad bots. I also have a [video course on WordPress security](https://m0n.co/securewp), for more plugin recommendations and lots of tips and tricks.
